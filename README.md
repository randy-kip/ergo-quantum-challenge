# Ergo Quantum Challenges

The challenges will assess problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and coding proficiency.

## Challenges Overview

### jacChallenge1: Square Root Approximation

- **Objective**: Implement an iterative procedure to compute the square root of a given number using the provided equation.
- **Description**: The challenge involves using the equation \(x_{n + 1} = x_{n} - \frac{x_{n} ^ 2 - a}{2x_{n}}\) to iteratively compute the square root of a given number \(a\).
- **Implementation**: Write Python code to compute the square root of \(a\) and include additional stopping criteria to prevent infinite loops.

### jacChallenge2: Matrix Product State Encoding

- **Objective**: Implement an algorithm to encode a vector into a matrix product state (MPS).
- **Description**: The challenge requires padding a vector, normalizing it, and performing singular value decomposition (SVD) to create an MPS representation.
- **Implementation**: Write Python code to perform the matrix product state encoding process as described in the challenge.
